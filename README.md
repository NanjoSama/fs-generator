# fs-generator
Generates random transactions and creates financial statements for it. This
program is meant to be used by fellow accountancy students looking to practice
preparing financial statements, journals, and ledgers. Thus, this README file
will assume that the reader is a COMPLETE stranger to Python, Github, and just
coding and programming in general.

## How to run
1. This program requires Python on your computer. You can download it
[here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe "Download Python").
You only need to check the checkbox that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH". This
is important for easy access to Python from the command line. If you're not
interested in coding in Python, I suggest not to touch anything else except
"Next" or "Install".
2. Click the "<> Code" button above then select "Download ZIP". Extract the
file anywhere you want.
3. Open up a command prompt or Windows Powershell in that folder. If you don't
know how, go the File tab on the top of your file manager and "Open Windows
PowerShell" should be there. Click on it.
4. Enter this line of code: `venv/Scripts/activate` and press Enter. Your
prompt should now look like `(venv) C:\User\...`
5. Enter this line of code: `python .` (Include the period otherwise it won't
work)

The program should now run. You can repeat step 5 any time after the program
ends to restart it. After you close the prompt, you can restart from step 3.

## FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

### An error occurred. What should I do?
Don't panic, you didn't break your computer or lose any data or anything.
The Python interpreter catches those errors and keeps them in the program.
It is completely safe to just restart the program again. What you can do, is
submit an issue to this repository (look at the top of the page), tell me what
the problem is, what you did that led to the error appearing, then copy and
paste the error message. I will look into it and release a patch as soon as I
can.

This section will be populated as more questions arise. Because I literally
cannot think of anything else lmao.
